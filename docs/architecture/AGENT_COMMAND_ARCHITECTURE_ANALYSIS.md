# Agent Command Architecture Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the agent command architecture, evaluating different approaches and providing concrete recommendations for implementation.

## Problem Statement

The current agent command architecture has several architectural issues:

1. **Rigid Command Separation**: False dichotomy between "Local Commands" and "Agent Commands"
2. **Tight Coupling**: Agents directly modify client session state (e.g., `Session.update_session`)
3. **Static Discovery**: Hardcoded command maps instead of dynamic discovery
4. **Architectural Inconsistency**: Commands that logically belong at both client and agent levels are forced into one category

## Analysis Framework

### Current Architecture Issues

- **Violation of Agent Boundaries**: `LLMAgent` directly calls `Session.update_session()`, creating tight coupling
- **Static Command Routing**: `@agent_commands` and `@local_commands` maps prevent dynamic discovery
- **Missing Agent Autonomy**: Agents cannot manage their own context, sessions, or specialized state
- **Limited Fault Isolation**: Agents modifying shared state reduces fault tolerance

### Key Architectural Questions

1. What are the fundamental capabilities ANY intelligent agent should have?
2. Which operations make sense at both client-level AND agent-level?
3. How should we handle command overlap (e.g., `/model` at client vs agent level)?
4. What's the difference between "agent context" vs "client context"?
5. Should agents have autonomous model/backend switching capabilities?
6. How do agent sessions relate to client sessions?
7. What recovery/resume capabilities should agents have?

## Background Job Processing Library Analysis

### Available Options

#### Oban
- **Purpose**: Persistent, database-backed background job processing
- **Features**: 
  - Transactional guarantees with PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite3
  - Job history and metrics retention
  - Scheduled jobs and uniqueness constraints
  - 15K+ jobs/second throughput
- **Best For**: Applications needing persistent job queues that survive restarts

#### Broadway
- **Purpose**: High-throughput stream processing built on GenStage

#### GenStage
- **Purpose**: Low-level producer-consumer coordination with back-pressure
- **Features**:
  - Direct control over data pipeline design
  - Custom back-pressure strategies
  - Maximum flexibility
- **Best For**: Custom producer-consumer architectures requiring fine-grained control

### Library Evaluation for CLI Context

**Why heavyweight job libraries are inappropriate:**

1. **Impedance Mismatch**: CLI commands are interactive and synchronous from user perspective
2. **Unnecessary Complexity**: Database dependencies and persistence not needed for CLI tasks
3. **Wrong Abstractions**: Back-pressure, batching, and stream processing don't map to discrete commands
4. **Over-engineering**: OTP primitives already provide what we need

## Proposed Solutions

### Option A: Refined GenServer Approach (RECOMMENDED)

Keep the current GenServer-per-task model but implement clean architectural patterns.

#### Pros:
- **Fault Isolation**: Agent crashes are completely isolated
- **Simplicity**: Ephemeral state exists only for task duration
- **Resource Efficiency**: Resources consumed only during active execution
- **Leverages OTP**: Uses Elixir's native supervision and fault tolerance
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure OTP solution

#### Cons:
- **No State Caching**: Cannot cache data between identical commands
- **Requires Refactoring**: Need to break existing tight coupling

#### Implementation Details:
- Keep `restart: :temporary` GenServers for agents
- Implement three-tier command model
- Create standardized Agent behavior contract
- Dynamic command discovery via agent registration

### Option B: Heavyweight Job Processing Library

Adopt Oban, Broadway, or similar for agent task execution.

#### Pros:
- **Battle-tested**: Mature libraries with proven reliability
- **Rich Features**: Built-in monitoring, retries, scheduling
- **Scalability**: Designed for high-throughput scenarios

#### Cons:
- **Over-engineering**: Massive complexity for CLI use case
- **External Dependencies**: Database requirements (Oban) or message brokers
- **Wrong Abstraction**: Designed for different problem domains
- **Performance Overhead**: Unnecessary persistence and queuing layers

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

Combine lightweight agent execution with selective use of job libraries.

#### Pros:
- **Flexibility**: Can choose right tool per use case
- **Gradual Migration**: Can evolve over time

#### Cons:
- **Complexity**: Multiple execution models to maintain
- **Inconsistency**: Different patterns for similar operations
- **Architecture Confusion**: Unclear when to use which approach

## Recommended Architecture: Three-Tier Command Model

### 1. Client-Bound Commands
**Pure local operations with no agent counterpart**

Commands: `/clear`, `/tui`, `/alias`, `/help`, `/exit`, `/quit`

Implementation: Direct CLI handling

### 2. Client-Orchestrated Commands  
**Client owns state, delegates validation/analysis to agents**

Commands: `/model switch`, `/backend`, `/context add`, `/system`, `/tokens`, `/strategy`

Implementation: 
- Client handler receives command
- Creates task_spec with context snapshot
- Dispatches to agent for validation/analysis
- Receives agent response via PubSub
- Client updates its own state based on result

Flow Example (`/model switch claude-3-opus`):
1. User issues command
2. Local handler creates validation task for LLMAgent
3. LLMAgent validates compatibility with current backend
4. Agent returns validation result
5. If valid, client updates session; if invalid, shows error

### 3. Agent-Exclusive Commands
**Pure analysis/recommendation tasks with no client state changes**

Commands: `/model recommend`, `/cost`, `/mcp discover`, `/stats`, `/export`

Implementation: Direct routing to specialized agents

## Base Agent Capabilities

### Agent Behavior Contract

```elixir
defmodule MCPChat.Agents.Agent do
  @callback available_commands() :: %{String.t() => map()}
  @callback handle_task(task_spec :: map()) :: {:ok, result :: map()} | {:error, reason :: any()}
  @callback validate_context(context :: map()) :: :ok | {:error, reason :: String.t()}
  @callback get_required_context_keys() :: [atom()]
end
```

### Standardized Task Specification

```elixir
%{
  command: "model_validate",
  args: ["claude-3-opus"],
  context: %{
    current_backend: "anthropic",
    current_model: "claude-3-sonnet", 
    user_preferences: %{},
    # Additional context as needed
  },
  session_id: "for-pubsub-routing-only"
}
```

### Core Capabilities All Agents Must Have

1. **Context Management**
   - Validate required context is provided
   - Request additional context keys as needed
   - Operate on context snapshot, never live session data

2. **Progress Reporting**
   - Standardized progress updates via PubSub
   - Consistent event format across all agents
   - Real-time feedback for long-running operations

3. **Error Handling**
   - Structured error responses with actionable information
   - Graceful degradation when possible
   - Clear error categorization (validation, execution, system)

4. **Resource Management**
   - Proper cleanup and timeout handling
   - Memory and resource leak prevention
   - Configurable timeout limits per operation

5. **Health/Status Reporting**
   - Basic health check capabilities
   - Status reporting for monitoring
   - Dependency validation (e.g., model availability)

## Command Overlap Resolution Strategy

Many commands have valid interpretations at both client and agent levels:

### Model Commands
- `/model` (no args) → Agent-Exclusive: Current model analysis + insights
- `/model recommend` → Agent-Exclusive: AI-powered recommendations
- `/model switch <name>` → Client-Orchestrated: Client updates state, agent validates

### Context Commands
- `/context` (no args) → Client-Bound: Show current context
- `/context add <file>` → Client-Orchestrated: Client manages files, agent can validate
- `/context analyze` → Agent-Exclusive: Analyze context effectiveness

### Backend Commands  
- `/backend` (no args) → Agent-Exclusive: Backend analysis and recommendations
- `/backend <name>` → Client-Orchestrated: Client switches, agent validates compatibility

## Agent Autonomy Guidelines

### Agents Should:
- Validate their context and requirements
- Perform analysis and recommendations  
- Return structured results with confidence levels
- Manage their own specialized state (model caches, etc.)
- Operate independently within their domain
- Provide rich metadata about their capabilities

### Agents Should NOT:
- Directly modify client session state
- Make autonomous state changes without client approval
- Access session data they weren't explicitly given
- Perform actions that affect other agents or the client directly
- Assume persistent state between invocations
