## Phase 1 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Project Initialization

**AI Implementation Prompt:**
"FIRST: Read and understand all reference documentation:
- `docs/arbor/01-overview/umbrella-structure.md` - Study the detailed project structure requirements
- `docs/arbor/01-overview/architecture-overview.md` - Understand system architecture principles
- `docs/arbor/03-contracts/README.md` - Learn the Contracts-First design approach

BEFORE STARTING: Verify all prerequisites are met - check that Elixir 1.15+, Erlang/OTP 26+, Mix, and Git are installed and available.

Create an Elixir umbrella project structure for Arbor as defined in the reference documentation. Start by creating the zero-dependency `arbor_contracts` application first, followed by `arbor_security`, `arbor_persistence`, and `arbor_core`, ensuring the dependency flow described in the documentation is respected. Each app should have supervision trees. Create a comprehensive .gitignore file for Elixir projects. The structure must follow the Contracts-First design principle.

AFTER COMPLETION: Verify all postrequisites are achieved - confirm umbrella project created with 4 supervised applications in correct dependency order, arbor_contracts as zero-dependency foundation, git repository initialized with initial commit, and .gitignore properly configured."

**Reference Documentation:**

- [Umbrella Structure](../01-overview/umbrella-structure.md) - Detailed project structure
- [Architecture Overview](../01-overview/architecture-overview.md) - System architecture principles
- [Contracts README](../03-contracts/README.md) - Contracts-First design approach

**Prerequisites:**

- Elixir 1.15+ and Erlang/OTP 26+ installed
- Mix available in PATH
- Git installed

**Commands:**

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir arbor && cd arbor

# Initialize umbrella project
mix new . --umbrella --module Arbor

# Create initial app structure following dependency order
cd apps
mix new arbor_contracts --module Arbor.Contracts --sup
mix new arbor_security --module Arbor.Security --sup
mix new arbor_persistence --module Arbor.Persistence --sup
mix new arbor_core --module Arbor.Core --sup
cd ..

# Initialize git repository

BEFORE STARTING: Verify prerequisites are met - confirm git repository is initialized and mix project structure exists.

Set up git pre-commit hooks to enforce the project's quality standards. The hooks should automate the validation of code formatting, static analysis (credo), and type safety (dialyzer), reflecting the 'defensive architecture' principles from the reference documentation. Also, create a `.tool-versions` file for asdf version management with Elixir 1.15.7 and Erlang 26.1, and a conventional commit message template as specified.

AFTER COMPLETION: Verify postrequisites are achieved - confirm pre-commit hook validates code quality, commit message template enforces conventional commits, and version management is configured with .tool-versions."

**Reference Documentation:**

- [BEAM Philosophy](../02-philosophy/beam-philosophy.md) - Defensive architecture principles

**Prerequisites:**

- Git repository initialized
- Mix project structure exists

**Commands and Configuration:**

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
set -e
echo "Running pre-commit checks..."

# Format code
mix format --check-formatted
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Code formatting issues found. Running mix format..."
    mix format
    echo "Please review and stage formatting changes."
    exit 1
fi

# Run credo
mix credo --strict
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Credo found issues. Please fix before committing."
    exit 1
fi

# Run dialyzer
mix dialyzer
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Dialyzer found type issues. Please fix before committing."
    exit 1
fi

# Run tests
mix test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests failed. Please fix before committing."
    exit 1
fi

echo "All pre-commit checks passed!"
EOF

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Setup commit message template
cat > .gitmessage << 'EOF'
# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# <body>
#
# <footer>
#
# Type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
# Scope: core, persistence, security, telemetry, deps
# Subject: imperative mood, max 50 chars
# Body: explain what and why, not how
# Footer: breaking changes, issues closed
EOF

git config commit.template .gitmessage
```
