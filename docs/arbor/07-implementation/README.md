# Arbor Implementation Guide

## Overview

This directory contains step-by-step implementation guides for building Arbor, a production-ready distributed AI agent orchestration system built on Elixir/OTP principles.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- **[Phase 1 MVP Implementation Plan](./phase-1-mvp.md)** - Complete setup guide with AI-friendly prompts
  - Project initialization and structure
  - Development environment setup
  - Git hooks and quality tools
  - CI/CD pipeline foundation
  - Core Gateway pattern implementation

### Phase 2: Core Features (Coming Soon)
- Agent registration and discovery
- Message routing and protocol implementation
- Basic persistence layer
- Session management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Coming Soon)
- Distributed deployment
- Advanced security capabilities
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring and observability

## Quick Start

To begin implementing Arbor, start with the [Phase 1 MVP Implementation Plan](./phase-1-mvp.md). This guide includes:

- Detailed commands for each step
- AI-friendly prompts for code generation
- Clear prerequisites and postrequisites
- Workflow diagrams

## Implementation Approach

Each implementation guide follows a consistent structure:

1. **Prerequisites** - What must be in place before starting
2. **Commands** - Exact commands to execute
3. **AI Prompts** - Detailed prompts for AI-assisted implementation
4. **Postrequisites** - Expected state after completion

This approach ensures:
- Reproducible results
- Clear progress tracking
- AI-tool compatibility
- Minimal ambiguity

## Contributing

When adding new implementation guides:

1. Follow the existing format structure
2. Include complete, working examples
3. Test all commands and code samples
4. Provide clear AI prompts with context
5. Document both success and error scenarios

## Support

For questions about implementation:
