# Section 01: Overview

This section provides high-level introduction to Arbor, its architecture, and overall system design.

## Documents in this Section

### [Architecture Overview](./architecture-overview.md)
Comprehensive overview of Arbor's distributed agent orchestration system, including:
- Executive overview and value propositions
- Core architectural principles
