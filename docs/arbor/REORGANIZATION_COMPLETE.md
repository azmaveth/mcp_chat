```

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Navigation**: Numbered sections guide readers progressively
2. **No Duplication**: Consolidated related documents
3. **Better Organization**: Related content grouped logically
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Clear structure for updates
5. **Legacy Preservation**: Old docs available but clearly marked

## 📝 Next Steps

### Short Term
- Add missing "Coming Soon" documents as needed
- Generate API documentation from code
- Create deployment guides

### Long Term
- Keep documentation synchronized with code
- Add more examples and tutorials
- Expand reference documentation

## 🔍 Quick Verification

To verify the reorganization:
```bash
# Check new structure
ls -la docs/arbor/*/

# Verify no broken links
grep -r "\.md](" docs/arbor --include="*.md" | grep -E "(ARBOR_|architecture/)"
# Should return no results

# Count total documents
find docs/arbor -name "*.md" | wc -l
```
