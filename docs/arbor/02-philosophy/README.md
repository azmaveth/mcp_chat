# Section 02: Philosophy

This section explores the design philosophy and principles that guide Arbor's development.

## Documents in this Section

### [BEAM Philosophy](./beam-philosophy.md)
How Arbor's contracts-first architecture aligns with and enhances the BEAM "let it crash" philosophy:
- Expected vs unexpected errors
- Boundary classification for validation strategies
- Benefits for distributed agent orchestration
- Testing and performance implications

### [Contracts-First Design](./contracts-first-design.md) *(Coming Soon)*
Deep dive into why we chose a contracts-first approach:
- Benefits of defining contracts before implementation
- How contracts enable better error handling
- Contract evolution and versioning

### [Design Principles](./design-principles.md) *(Coming Soon)*
Core principles that guide all architectural decisions:
- Simplicity over complexity
- Explicit over implicit
- Composition over inheritance
- Fault tolerance by design

## Key Philosophy Points

1. **Let It Crash - With Intent**: We validate expected errors at boundaries while letting unexpected errors crash cleanly
2. **Contracts as Documentation**: Our contracts serve as living documentation of system behavior
3. **Defensive Architecture, Not Defensive Programming**: Protect at boundaries, trust internally
4. **Production-First Thinking**: Every design decision considers production operations

## How Philosophy Influences Design

- **Error Handling**: Different strategies for different boundaries
- **State Management**: Event sourcing for auditability and recovery
- **Security Model**: Capability-based with explicit grants
- **Testing Strategy**: Property-based testing aligned with contracts

## Next Steps

After understanding the philosophy:
- [Contracts](../03-contracts/README.md) - See philosophy in practice
- [Architecture](../05-architecture/README.md) - Explore architectural patterns
- [Components](../04-components/README.md) - Examine component design
