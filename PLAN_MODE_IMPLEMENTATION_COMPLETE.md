**After**: Preview → understand → approve → execute safely

This addresses the primary user concern about AI tools: **lack of control and transparency** in what actions will be taken.

## 📈 Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

While Plan Mode is complete and production-ready, future enhancements could include:

1. **Visual Plan Editor**: Drag-drop step arrangement in web UI
2. **Collaborative Plans**: Multi-user approval workflows  
3. **Plan Templates**: Save and reuse common patterns
4. **AI Plan Learning**: Improve generation based on success rates
5. **Advanced Rollback**: Git-based state management
6. **Plan Analytics**: Success metrics and optimization insights

## 🏆 Conclusion

Plan Mode successfully delivers on its core promise: **safety-first AI code execution with complete transparency and user control**. The implementation provides a robust foundation for confident AI-assisted development while maintaining the flexibility to handle complex workflows.

**Plan Mode is ready for production use and represents a significant advancement in AI coding tool safety and user experience.**
