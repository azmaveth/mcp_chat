## Technical Debt and Known Issues

### Current Technical Debt
- None yet (starting fresh implementation)

### Known Limitations
- Phase 1 has performance bottleneck with central SecurityKernel
- No distributed capability validation yet
- Limited constraint language (map-based only)
- No process isolation beyond OTP

### Future Refactoring Needed
- Move to signed tokens for distributed validation (Phase 2)
- Implement more sophisticated constraint DSL
- Add MuonTrap integration for process isolation
- Consider distributed state management

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Performance Bottleneck** - Central SecurityKernel may not scale
   - **Mitigation:** Implement local caching, plan for Phase 2 tokens
   
2. **Complex Integration** - Many systems need security integration
   - **Mitigation:** Phased rollout, backward compatibility
   
3. **Edge Case Handling** - Complex delegation and revocation scenarios
   - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing, clear error handling

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Audit Log Volume** - High-frequency operations may overwhelm logging
   - **Mitigation:** Log filtering, async logging, sampling
   
2. **State Persistence** - DETS limitations for high-frequency writes
   - **Mitigation:** Batch persistence, consider upgrade path

### Low Risk Items
1. **API Usability** - Developers may find security cumbersome
   - **Mitigation:** Good documentation, helper functions, clear examples

## Success Metrics
