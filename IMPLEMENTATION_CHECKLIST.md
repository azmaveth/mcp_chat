## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: Security Model

**ðŸŽ‰ Phase 2 Enhanced UX COMPLETED! All Terminal Enhancements Implemented:**
- âœ… **Intelligent Autocomplete**: Full implementation with learning system and terminal integration
- âœ… **Terminal Polish**: Complete terminal enhancement suite with all components
- âœ… **Terminal Integration**: Full autocomplete integration with keyboard navigation

**Next Major Feature: Security Model (Phase 3)**

With Phase 2 complete, we're now focusing on **Security Model** implementation for production readiness:

1. **Process isolation** - BEAM sandboxing and MuonTrap integration
2. **Permission system** - Capability-based security with fine-grained controls
3. **Audit system** - Comprehensive security event logging and monitoring

This will provide:
- Production-ready security for AI agent orchestration
- Safe execution of AI-generated code
- Enterprise-grade permission management
- Comprehensive audit trails for compliance

**Visual Interface** has been deprioritized in favor of core security features needed for production deployment.
