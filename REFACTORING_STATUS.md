# MCP Chat CLI Commands Refactoring Status

## Current Status (2025-01-24)

### Completed ✅
1. **Created base behavior module** (`MCPChat.CLI.Commands.Base`)
   - Defines common command interface
   - Provides helper functions (show_error, show_success, etc.)
   - Includes argument parsing utilities

2. **Split commands into 6 focused modules**:
   - `session.ex` - Session management commands (new, save, load, sessions, history)
   - `utility.ex` - Utility commands (help, clear, config, cost, export)
   - `llm.ex` - LLM commands (backend, model, models, loadmodel, unloadmodel, acceleration)
   - `mcp.ex` - MCP commands (servers, discover, connect, disconnect, tools, resources, prompts)
   - `context.ex` - Context commands (context, system, tokens, strategy)
   - `alias.ex` - Alias management commands

3. **Updated main commands.ex** to be a simple router
   - Reduced from 1,191 lines to ~130 lines
   - Now just routes commands to appropriate modules
   - Cyclomatic complexity reduced from 37 to < 5

4. **Fixed most compilation issues**:
   - Updated renderer function calls (`render_*` -> `show_*`)
   - Fixed module references and aliases
   - Fixed data structure access patterns (cost_info, context stats)
   - Added missing Session functions (set_current_session, update_session, set_system_prompt)
   - Removed duplicate function definitions in LLM module
   - Fixed Config.get calls to use proper syntax

### Remaining Issues ❌
1. **Compilation error in utility module**
   - Missing `end` statement somewhere in the file
   - Compiler reports issue with line 105 but actual problem may be elsewhere
   - File structure appears correct but needs careful review

2. **Tests need updating**
   - Test files still expect old module structure
   - Need to update references to command functions
   - May need to mock the new modular structure

3. **Minor warnings remain**:
   - Some typing/dialyzer warnings about undefined functions
   - Unused module attributes
   - Deprecated Logger.warn usage

### Benefits Achieved
- **Reduced complexity**: Main commands module went from cyclomatic complexity of 37 to < 5
- **Better organization**: Commands are now logically grouped
- **Easier maintenance**: Each module focuses on one area
- **Improved testability**: Smaller modules are easier to test in isolation

### Next Steps
1. Fix the compilation error in utility module
2. Update test files to work with new module structure
3. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
4. Address remaining Credo warnings
5. Consider further extraction of common patterns

## Code Metrics Comparison

### Before Refactoring
- `commands.ex`: 1,191 lines, complexity 37
- Single monolithic module handling all commands
- Difficult to navigate and maintain

### After Refactoring
- `commands.ex`: ~130 lines, complexity < 5
- 6 focused modules, each < 300 lines
- Average complexity per module: < 10
- Clear separation of concerns
