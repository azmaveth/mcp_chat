# ExLLM Migration Status

## Summary

All LLM provider adapters have been successfully migrated from mcp_chat to the ex_llm library:

### Migrated Adapters
- ✅ **Anthropic** - Already existed in ex_llm
- ✅ **Local** - Already existed in ex_llm
- ✅ **OpenAI** - Migrated from mcp_chat/lib/mcp_chat/llm/openai.ex
- ✅ **Ollama** - Migrated from mcp_chat/lib/mcp_chat/llm/ollama.ex
- ✅ **AWS Bedrock** - Migrated from mcp_chat/lib/mcp_chat/llm/bedrock.ex
- ✅ **Google Gemini** - Migrated from mcp_chat/lib/mcp_chat/llm/gemini.ex

### Updated Files in ex_llm
1. `lib/ex_llm/adapters/openai.ex` - New OpenAI adapter
2. `lib/ex_llm/adapters/ollama.ex` - New Ollama adapter
3. `lib/ex_llm/adapters/bedrock.ex` - New AWS Bedrock adapter (simplified)
4. `lib/ex_llm/adapters/gemini.ex` - New Google Gemini adapter
5. `lib/ex_llm.ex` - Updated to register all new adapters
6. `README.md` - Updated documentation to reflect all supported providers
7. `TASKS.md` - Updated to mark all adapters as implemented
8. `CHANGELOG.md` - Added entries for new adapters

### Current State

The mcp_chat project still uses its own adapter files directly rather than going through ExLLMAdapter. This is because:

1. The CLI commands (`lib/mcp_chat/cli/commands/llm.ex`) directly reference adapter modules
2. The MCP server handler (`lib/mcp_chat/mcp_server/handler.ex`) directly references adapter modules
3. Tests are written against the original adapter modules

### Next Steps

To complete the migration and remove duplication:

1. **Update mcp_chat to use ExLLMAdapter exclusively**
   - Modify `get_adapter_module/1` in CLI commands to return ExLLMAdapter
   - Pass provider as an option instead of using different modules
   - Update MCP server handler similarly

2. **Remove redundant files**
   - Delete all adapter files from `lib/mcp_chat/llm/` except:
     - `adapter.ex` (the behaviour definition)
     - `ex_llm_adapter.ex` (the bridge to ex_llm)
     - `exla_config.ex` and `model_loader.ex` (if not using ex_llm versions)

3. **Update tests**
   - Rewrite adapter tests to use ExLLMAdapter with provider parameter
   - Or remove them if adequately covered by ex_llm tests

### Benefits of Migration

1. **Single source of truth** - All LLM logic in ex_llm library
2. **Reusability** - Other Elixir projects can use ex_llm
3. **Maintainability** - Updates only needed in one place
4. **Consistency** - All providers follow the same patterns
5. **Testing** - Centralized test suite for all providers

### Notes

- The AWS Bedrock adapter in ex_llm is simplified and would need AWS SDK integration for full functionality
- All adapters maintain API compatibility with the original mcp_chat versions
- Cost tracking and context management are now handled by ex_llm core functionality
